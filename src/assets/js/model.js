We will have live music, speakers, games and contests, a "kids zone" full of activities and prizes, great food and much more! Representatives from healthcare organizations, in-patient and out-patient recovery centers, 12-step groups, and non-profit organizations, are invited to host a booth to provide information and resources to our community.</p><h4>Who We Are</h4><p><strong><a href="http://www.springsrecoveryconnection.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Springs Recovery Connection:</a></strong><blockquote>Is a non-profit organization serving the community of Colorado Springs and surrounding areas.
